This is a bot which helps to manage 15x4 processes
Bot functions:
- Creating rehearsals, send notification to chats and channels
- Creating lectors with profiles (it can be useful for creating events)
- Creating lecturers based on created lectors
- Reminding about empty description for lecturers (we had a problem when we prepare an event, we forget to ask descriptions before, so collect all unrgently)
- Creating events and send notifications to chats and channels

How to use:
1. Install `docker` (>=18.09.2) and `docker-compose` (>1.25.0)
2. Copy config file from `.env-sample` to `.env` file
3. Setup all needed environment variables:
    3.1. REQUIRED VARIABLE: Admin account tg username in the `ADMIN_ACCOUNT` environment variable (reqiured). Example (should be without `@`): 
    ...
    ADMIN_ACCOUNT=my_username
    ...
    3.2. REQUIRED VARIABLE: Token for telegram bot in the `TG_TOKEN` - you need to create new bot through @BotFather (command `/newbot`). Example:
    ...
    TG_TOKEN=566944285:AAHQ_GcpSKdGy_rrGrTnN9NtRcBcvBnP2KI
    ...
    3.3. REQUIRED VARIABLE: `MAIN_CHANNEL_USERNAME` - general public channel for the branch. Example:
    ...
    MAIN_CHANNEL_USERNAME=@test15x4
    ...
    3.4. REQUIRED VARIABLE: `ORG_CHANNEL_USERNAME` - channel for lectors of the branch (internal). Here you can send notification of the next rehearsal. Example:
    ...
    ORG_CHANNEL_USERNAME=@test15x4
    ...
    3.5. OPTIONAL VARIABLE: `ORG_CHAT_ID` - internal chat for the branch (like flood chat). Here you can send notification of the next rehearsal. Example:
    ...
    ORG_CHAT_ID=-389484898
    ...
    This value you can get after adding bot to the chat (in the logs). There is no other way to get chat id in the Telegram
    3.6. OPTIONAL VARIABLE: `GRAMMER_NAZI_CHAT_ID` - chat for grammar-nazi. When you create a new lecture, you can send description of the lecture in the special editors chat for validation. Can be empty. Example: 
    ...
    GRAMMER_NAZI_CHAT_ID=-389484898
    ...
    3.7. OPTIONAL VARIABLE: `DESIGNER_CHAT_ID` - chat of designers. When you create an event, you can send all prepared information to the designers chat. You can find it in the event menu. Can be empty. Example:
    ...
    DESIGNER_CHAT_ID=-389484898
    ...
    
4. Run `make`. It will create all needed docker containers, volumes and networks. You will see logs in output after starting
